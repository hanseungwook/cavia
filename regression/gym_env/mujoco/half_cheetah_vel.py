    The half-cheetah follows the dynamics from MuJoCo [2], and receives at each
    time step a reward composed of a control cost and a penalty equal to the
    difference between its current velocity and the target velocity. The tasks
    are generated by sampling the target velocities from the uniform
    distribution on [0, 2].
